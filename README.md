"Some basic number Guessers"

binary:

This one gives you the most attempts it should take to guess
a number if you guess in the middle of the range each time.

computer:

The computer randomly guesses between a user inputted range.
I had planned on enhancing the computer by giving it binary searching
capabilities, but for now it just doesn't go above or below the number it had guessed if it was too high or too low compared to the number the computer needs to guess. Also it doesn't reguess the same number.
